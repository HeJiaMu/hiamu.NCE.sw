## Six centuriess ago, Sir John Hawkwood settled near Florence, and hired his soldiers to princes.
## During peacetime, he and his men would threaten to destroy a city-state unless paid protection money.
## To prevent persecution, the Italians considered him a hero.
## He died at the age of eighty, and the Florentines honored him with a state funeral, commissioning a painting dedicated to the memory of ‘the most valiant soldier and most notable leader’.
