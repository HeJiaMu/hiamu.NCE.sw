# Lesson8
## St. Bernard's monastery is visited by thousands of people in summer.
## As there are so many people, the dogs have to be kept in a special enclosure.
## The temperature drops to -30Â° and few people cross the pass, so the monks prefer winter.
## The dogs are allowed to wander outside.
## The only regular visitors to the monastery in winter are parties of skiers who go there at Christmas and Easter, they always receive a warm welcome there.
