## George was going to the sweet shop while his 50 pence ***bounced*** down a drain.
## He took his jacket off and pushed his arm through the drain cover.
## He failed to find his money and couldn't get his arm out.
## A crowd of people gathered round him, and a lady rubbed his arm with many things.
## Failed to get it out, ~~she suggested him to pull out his arm together with the drain cover~~ firemen were called, and freed George using grease.
## After the shop owner heard this **event**, she rewarded him with chocolates.
