## George was going to the sweet shop while his 50 pence ***bounced*** into a drain.
## He took his jacket off and pushed his right arm through the drain cover.
## He failed to find his 50 pounds and couldn't get his arm out.
## A crowd of people gather round him, and a lady rubbed his arm with many things to try to get his arm out.
## Failed to get his arm out, ~~she suggested him to pull out his arm together with the drain cover~~ firemen were called, and freed George using grease.
## After the sweet shop owner heard this **event**, she rewarded him with a large box of chocolates.
