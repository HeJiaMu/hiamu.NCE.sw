## When Franz Bussman and his wife were on a trip, Franz talked to a workman.
## Later, his wife told him that that man was similar to him and might be his brother who was considered to be dead.
## Franz denied.
## After a few days, his wife sent a boy to ask the man if he was called Hans Bussman.
## He was!
## He had been survived from a war!
## What a chance in a million!
