# Lesson12
## Two men were taking a badly damaged boat to Miami, and it began to sink on the way.
## They quickly loaded a dinghy with food, matches, and beer and rowed across the Caribbean until they arrived at an island.
## They collected water in the dinghy and caught fish and lobsters with a spare gun.
## They ’ate like kings‘ for five days, and then rescued by a tanker.
