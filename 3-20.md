## Bleriot and Latham arrived at Calais On July 21, 1909.
## It looked as if there would be a race across the channel, but Latham failed to get up early enough, and didn't take part in the race.
## Bleriot made a short test flight before starting the trip which lasted for 37 minutes.
## The first person to greet him was a policeman.
## Latham landed on the sea half a mile to Dover because his engine failed.
